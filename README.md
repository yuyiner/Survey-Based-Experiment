# Survey-Based-Experiment

This project designed and executed a survey-based experiment using Qualtrics to investigate the impact of displaying other customers' choices on the ordering rate. With 300 responses collected, conducted hypothesis tests in R and found a statistically significant increase in ordering rate when peer choices were displayed. Additionally, used GPower to conduct a power analysis and determine the optimal sample size for the survey. Presented findings using PowerPoint, showcasing the importance of social influence in shaping consumer behavior.
